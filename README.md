A Vite plugin that **automatically adds `@reference` directive to Vue SFC `<style>` blocks** (if it contains `@apply`). This is done at Vite code transformation step so **nothing will be added in your codebase!** üëª

‚ö° This seamless integration allows developers to leverage [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) features while **maintaining compatibility** with their existing codebase, making migration a breeze.

‚ö° By automatically handling `@reference` directive, this plugin **ensures consistent styling** across your application as you transition to Tailwind CSS v4.

‚ö° Whether you're migrating from Tailwind CSS v3 or just starting out with Tailwind CSS v4, this plugin provides an **efficient way to globally manage styles** in your Vue projects.

## Compatibility

Tested with Node 20+, Vite 6, Vue 3.5 and Tailwind CSS v4. It might work with older versions but is untested and unsupported there.

## Installation

Install the plugin from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-vue-auto-tailwind-reference) with your preferred package manager:

```bash
# NPM
npm install vite-plugin-vue-auto-tailwind-reference --save-dev

# Yarn
yarn add vite-plugin-vue-auto-tailwind-reference --dev

# PNPM
pnpm add vite-plugin-vue-auto-tailwind-reference -D
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Import and register the plugin in your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`. By default, the plugin assumes your CSS file is located at `src/index.css`. You can override this in advanced configuration.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Register this plugin **before** the official `tailwindcss()` plugin.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import tailwindAutoReference from "vite-plugin-vue-auto-tailwind-reference";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue(), tailwindAutoReference(), tailwindcss()],
});
```

Use the `@apply` directive normally in your Vue component style blocks:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="myClass">Hello, Tailwind!</div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.myClass {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-4;
}
</style>
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize the plugin with parameters:

- `cssFile`: Path(s) to your Tailwind CSS file(s). Default is `./src/index.css`. Can be a string, an array of strings, or a function returning paths.
- `opts`: Additional options such as `include`, `exclude`, and `skip` patterns.

Example:

```js
tailwindAutoReference("./src/tailwind.css", {
  include: [/\.vue\?.*type=style/, /\.scss/],
  exclude: /node_modules/,
  skip: (code, id) => code.includes("@reference"),
});
```

See the [Usage](#usage) section for more details on advanced options.
